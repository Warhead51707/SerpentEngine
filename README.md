# Welcome to Serpent
Serpent Engine is a small engine built upon the MonoGame framework. Sepent uses a GameObject based ECS to make the monogame development process similar to modern game engine practices, while remaining 100% code focused. This no gui engine is designed to make the monogame development process less monotonous and faster.
